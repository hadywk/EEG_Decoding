# EEG_Decoding
EEG is a technique used to record activity in the brain. During this non-painful examination,
tiny sensors are placed on the scalp to recognize electrical impulses generated by the brain.
The signals are recorded by a headset, and a physician analyzes them. The capacity to type
using direct brain control, Which improves the accuracy of decoding EEG signals for a variety
of brain functions., is one of the most exciting and contentious EEG-based BCI applications.
BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) makes possible the translation of thought to text. A fresh and
growing field The electroencephalogram (EEG) represents electrical activity at the surface of
the brain. The "Brain Decoding using EEG signals: Turning Thoughts into Text" project aims
to develop a system that can translate a person’s thoughts into written text using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to interpret the
EEG signals and gather data on the user’s intended words. This information is then used to
generate text that accurately reflects the user’s thoughts. Once the algorithms have extracted
this information, it is used to generate text that accurately reflects the user’s thoughts. The generated text can be displayed on a computer screen or other output device, allowing the user to
communicate their thoughts and ideas without the need for speech or typing.
