# Brain Decoding using EEG Signals: Turning Thoughts into Text

Welcome to the "Brain Decoding using EEG Signals: Turning Thoughts into Text" project! This repository contains the code and documentation for developing a system that translates a person's thoughts into written text using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

## Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique used to record electrical activity in the brain. During this non-painful examination, tiny sensors are placed on the scalp to recognize electrical impulses generated by the brain. The signals are recorded by a headset, and a physician typically analyzes them.

One of the most exciting and contentious applications of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is the capacity to type using direct brain control. This project aims to improve the accuracy of decoding EEG signals for a variety of brain functions, making the translation of thought to text possible.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can translate a person’s thoughts into written text using EEG signals. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to interpret the EEG signals and gather data on the user’s intended words. This information is then used to generate text that accurately reflects the user’s thoughts. The generated text can be displayed on a computer screen or other output devices, allowing the user to communicate their thoughts and ideas without the need for speech or typing.

## Features

- **EEG Signal Acquisition**: Capture and record electrical activity from the brain using EEG sensors.
- **Signal Processing**: Process and clean the raw EEG data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Use advanced machine learning algorithms to interpret EEG signals.
- **Text Generation**: Translate the interpreted EEG signals into written text.
- **Output Display**: Display the generated text on a computer screen or other output devices.
